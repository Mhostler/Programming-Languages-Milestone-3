# Programming-Languages-Milestone-3
Milestone 3 is the addition of a lexer and implementation of context free grammar into language, as well as interpreting a java code segment into our new language.

Most files given by instructor to make work. Files changed by students include lexer.spec, expressions.bnf and three_x_plus_1.tgt.

Three x plus one is the former java program that is written in our new language.
